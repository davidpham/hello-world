<p>My name is David. I am originally from the Boston area, but I have also had the amazing opportunity to call Shanghai, New York City, and Washington DC my cities. My go-to favorite activities over the course of the year are enjoying a few beers at baseball games in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. I also pretend to like runningâ€¦ I read the Economist every Sunday morning to keep updated on current events and read all things tech and international development on a daily bases.  </p>
